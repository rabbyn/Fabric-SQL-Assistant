# Fabric Data Warehouse Schema Discovery Updates

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to improve compatibility with Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse endpoints.

## Problem Statement
The original schema discovery logic was designed for traditional Azure SQL Database and failed when working with Fabric Data Warehouse due to:
- Different system view capabilities
- Limited foreign key constraint metadata
- Varying levels of INFORMATION_SCHEMA support across Fabric configurations

## Key Changes Made

### 1. db.py - Enhanced get_table_schema() Function
**Before:** Single complex query with LEFT JOINs for constraints
**After:** Separated queries with fallback mechanisms

**Improvements:**
- Fabric-compatible basic schema query
- Separate primary key discovery with error handling
- Fallback to basic schema when constraints aren't available
- Enhanced column metadata collection (precision, scale, defaults)
- Graceful degradation with informative messages

### 2. mcp_server.py - Enhanced handle_discover_schema() Function
**Before:** Single complex query trying to get all metadata at once
**After:** Multi-stage discovery with robust error handling

**Improvements:**
- Separated basic table/column discovery from constraint discovery
- Independent primary key and foreign key queries
- Fabric-specific error messages and user guidance
- Enhanced response formatting with Fabric branding
- Better handling of missing relationship metadata

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Multiple try/catch blocks for different query types
- Specific error messages for Fabric limitations
- Fallback strategies when advanced features aren't available
- User-friendly explanations of what's normal vs. problematic

### 4. Improved User Experience
- Fabric Data Warehouse branding in responses
- Clear messaging about what features are/aren't available
- Better progress indicators during discovery
- Compatibility notes in schema responses

## Technical Details

### SQL Query Changes
1. **Basic Schema Query**: Now uses explicit schema joins and filtering
2. **Primary Key Query**: Separated with proper error handling
3. **Foreign Key Query**: Uses REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS with fallbacks
4. **Fallback Query**: Minimal query when advanced features fail

### Error Handling Strategy
- Try advanced queries first
- Fall back to basic queries on failure
- Provide informative error messages
- Continue operation even when some metadata isn't available

### Compatibility Matrix
| Feature | Traditional Azure SQL | Fabric Data Warehouse |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Basic Tables/Columns | ✅ | ✅ |
| Primary Keys | ✅ | ✅ (with fallback) |
| Foreign Keys | ✅ | ⚠️ (limited/optional) |
| Column Metadata | ✅ | ✅ |
| Constraint Details | ✅ | ⚠️ (limited) |

## Testing
- All SQL queries validated for syntax
- Error handling paths verified
- Fallback mechanisms tested
- User messaging reviewed for clarity

## Usage Notes
Users can expect:
- Schema discovery to work with any Fabric SQL endpoint
- Graceful handling of missing constraint information
- Clear feedback about what metadata is/isn't available
- Continued functionality even with limited metadata support

## Files Modified
- `db.py` - Core schema discovery logic
- `mcp_server.py` - MCP server schema handling
- `README.md` - Updated documentation
- `.gitignore` - Added temporary files
- `requirements.txt` - Added for dependency management
